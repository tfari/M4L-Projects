# CLOCK

Stopwatch Max4Live audio device to measure the total time spent working on a project.
<br/>
Use the bottom slider to specify every how many minutes CLOCK saves its state. 
If values over 1 minute are used, the minute display will update at that rate as well.

(This is done in order to not clog the undo history.)
