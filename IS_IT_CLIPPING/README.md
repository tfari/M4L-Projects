# IS_IT_CLIPPING

Sit this device in your chain in order to to catch clipping.
The big button will become red when there is clipping, and won't turn off until the user manually toggles it.
This is specially useful when using external plugins, refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=433&v=CGRusg9GnAg&feature=youtu.be)
