<br/>

Implements controls for every knob and switch, so as to provide a ground for midi programming. 

Place before an External Instrument.

Use in combination with [MIDI_MAPPER](https://github.com/tfari/M4L-Projects/tree/main/MIDI_MAPPER) to extend the expressive capabilities of the Minilogue.

It also implements several way of randomizing the controls: in general, by section, or even by control. 

The VCO sliders can be set in three modes: ST, C and ALL.

* **ST** : Slide only between semitones
* **C**: Slide only between -100 and 100 cts
* **ALL**: All possible values.
