# MIDI_LATCH
Max4Live device for latching MIDI notes.
Notes can be inputed either through the normal midi input, or by clicking on the visual keyboard accesed by the ">" button. 
The velocity slider over it is for the notes inputed by clicking.
The "INPUT VEL" button transforms all normal midi input velocities into the one specified.
Disabling the "LATCH" button allows for normal midi data to pass through without turning off the latched notes. 
"STOP" clears all latched notes, otherwise, all of them can be deactivated using the visual keyabord
