Implements controls for every knob and switch, so as to provide a ground for midi programming. 

Place before an External Instrument, you will need a different Midi Track for each part, and select the respective MIDI channel to control each PART. 

It also implements several way of randomizing the controls: generally by layers and by controls (Wave Guide and Bit Reduction, Fold, Drive and Gain), also every knob has a dedicated **R** and **D** buttons, to randomize or default that control in particular.

For each layer, the first tabbed-button control controls the source (sine, saw, high-pass filtered noise, low-pass filtered noise, band-pass filtered noise), the second the modulation source, the third the amp's eg.
